## Project Overview

This project is a **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** developed in **Python** using the **Pygame** library. The visualizer supports multiple popular sorting algorithms, allowing users to see how different sorting techniques work in real time.

The visualization provides control over the sorting speed (via FPS control) and the ability to reverse or step through the sorting process. It's an educational tool for anyone looking to understand or teach sorting algorithms visually.

## Features

- Visualization of multiple sorting algorithms.
- User-controlled sorting speed using keyboard arrows.
- Step forward/backward through the sorting process.
- Real-time feedback on how algorithms manipulate data.
- Intuitive and easy-to-use interface built with Pygame.

## Supported Algorithms

This visualizer supports the following sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Insertion Sort**
3. **Selection Sort**
4. **Heap Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Merge Sort**
7. **Bogo Sort** (for fun!)

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

You can install the required libraries with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements
